## Quality Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- **Length**: 1000-2000 words minimum
- **Sources**: Cite at least 5-10 different sources
- **Web Searches**: Perform at least 3-5 different searches
- **Recency**: Prioritize information from last 1-2 years
- **Structure**: Use proper markdown formatting with headers, lists, bold/italic

### Best Practices
- Use clear, professional language
- Break up long sections with subheadings
- Use bullet points and lists for readability
- Include statistics and data points
- Add inline citations [¹] [²] [³]
- Bold important terms and key points
- Use blockquotes for important quotes
- Add horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections

## File Management

1. **Create research directory** if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p research
   ```

2. **Save report** to: `research/{filename}.md`
   - Use descriptive filename (lowercase, underscores instead of spaces)
   - Example: `research/ai_safety_trends.md`

3. **Include metadata** at the top of the file:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Research Report: [Topic]"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   researcher: Claude AI Assistant
   topic: [Research Topic]
   ---
   ```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Thorough**: Don't rush - comprehensive research takes time
2. **Be Accurate**: Verify information across multiple sources
3. **Be Objective**: Present balanced perspectives, note disagreements
4. **Be Current**: Focus on recent developments
5. **Be Clear**: Write for a general audience, explain technical terms
6. **Be Professional**: Maintain a formal, academic tone
7. **Be Honest**: If information is limited or uncertain, say so
8. **Add Value**: Provide analysis and synthesis, not just facts

## Example Web Search Queries

For a topic like "AI Safety Trends":
1. "AI safety research 2024 latest developments"
2. "artificial intelligence safety concerns experts"
3. "AI alignment problem current state"
4. "AI governance regulations 2024"
5. "machine learning safety mechanisms"

## Error Handling

If you encounter issues:
- **Limited Results**: Try different search terms, broader queries
- **Conflicting Information**: Present both perspectives, note the conflict
- **Missing Data**: Acknowledge gaps, use available information
- **Access Issues**: Use alternative sources, WebFetch different URLs
